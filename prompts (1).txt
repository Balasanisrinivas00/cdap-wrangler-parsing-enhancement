1. How to implement a parser in Java to convert human-readable byte sizes like '10 MB' or '2.5 GB' into bytes?
2. Create a utility class in Java that parses time durations like '5 min', '2 h', '30 s' into milliseconds.
3. How to modify an ANTLR grammar file (Directives.g4) to include new tokens BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION?
4. Show me how to update GrammarBasedParser.java to support new parsing types like BYTE_SIZE and TIME_DURATION.
5. How to write unit tests for parsing byte sizes and time durations in Java using JUnit?
6. Edge cases to consider when parsing human-readable sizes like '0 KB', '1.5 GB', '1024MB', ' 5min '.
7. Generate a PDF report with code snippets and summary of implementation using Python.
